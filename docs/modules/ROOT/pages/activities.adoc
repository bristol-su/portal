= Activities

The portal calls any service being delivered an 'Activity', since users
of the portal may undertake this activity. An activity could be any
process your organisation delivers, such as expense claims, trip
registration or complaint handling.

A service is made up of many steps. To demonstrate what we mean, we'll
be looking into the expense claims service, which allows staff members
to submit receipts and be refunded. This service can be represented by a
series of steps, undertaken by different people to allow the expense
claim to be refunded.
